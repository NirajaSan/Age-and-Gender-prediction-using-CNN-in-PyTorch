# Age-and-Gender-prediction-using-CNN-in-PyTorch

1. During my deep learning and computer vision internship, I undertook a project, "Age and Gender Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Network".

2. I used PyTorch and Python with the UTKFace and wiki crop datasets to build and train a CNN model.

3. This project boosted my understanding of deep learning, computer vision, Python, problem-solving and teamwork skills with professionals.

4. I used data augmentation technique in wiki crop dataset.
